# Project Overview
This is a full-stack web application that I created using Next.js 14. In this application, there are two main types of users: Team Member and Admin. Both users share the same dashboard but have different permissions.

Admins can easily update any products without needing approval. However, when a Team Member updates a product, it requires approval from an Admin before the changes are reflected on the dashboard.

## Authentication
- The platform allows users to register as either a Team Member or an Admin.
- During login, users do not need to specify their role (e.g., Admin or Team Member). Their role is automatically determined based on the information provided during the registration process.

# Features
## Team members section:
- Team members can view a list of all products on their dashboard.
- Upon selecting a product, they can edit its title, image, and other details on a product detail page.
- The product image can be uploaded to Firebase Cloud Storage, with options for cropping and editing before uploading.
- After making changes, team members can submit these for review, where the changes are saved as unapproved data in a MongoDB collection.
- A separate page allows team members to track the status of their submissions, with states such as "pending," "rejected," or "approved."

## Admin Section:
- Admins can also see the same list of all products on their dashboard.
- Admins can access a product detail page to modify all parameters of the products.
- Admins can directly update products by clicking the "save" button, which sends an API request to update the product without requiring further approval.
- Admins can review change requests submitted by team members on a dedicated pending reviews page.
- If a change request is approved by an admin, the product is updated, and the status in the reviews collection is set to "approved."
- If a change request is rejected, the status is updated to "rejected."
- Admins can also see the total number of pending requests, approved requests, and rejected requests on their profile page.


## Profile section
- Both Admins and Team Members have a Profile section.
- Stats displayed on this page include:
  - Number of Requests
  - Number of Pending Requests
  - Number of Rejected Requests

3. Dashboard (/dashboard)
   - Accessible by both Admin and Team Members.
   - Session token is used to differentiate between the Admin and Team Member dashboards.

   - Accessible only to Team Members with their submissions.
7. Pending Requests (/pending-requests)
   - Accessible only to users with the Admin role.
